# GeoSense
This repository is the hub for documentation and files created for the project dubbed "GeoSence". 

The goal of this project is to make a circuit to allow for more accurate measuring of a thermistor.
To do achieve this goal a instrumentation amplifier circuit has ben designed for the respective thermistor and operating range of the application.

A later goal is to wright a program that will interpret the circuits output from an A to D to get and log the temperatures measured.
